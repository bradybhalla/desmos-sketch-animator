# desmos-sketch-animator

I didn't finish this project, I got the sketching but not the animating. It is also not optimized.  I won't be able to work on this for a very long time (if ever), so I am archiving it.

## Setup
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Controls
  - Hold `d` to draw
  - Press `n` to create a new drawing
  - Press `Shift+e` to copy Desmos equations.  Note that this does not work if the current drawing is empty.
